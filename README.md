## MandelbrotCMS
MandelbrotCMS is a system built from scratch that is meant to help organizaing different aspects of life 
and making them clearer. 
I desided to build this project because of:
  - It will rise my experience and improve my skills in exponential way
  - It will be a very good portfolio project
  - I wanted to have my own system and domain in a way I like
